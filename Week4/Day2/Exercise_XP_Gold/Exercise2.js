// Exercise 2: Analyzing the reduce method

// The code to analyze:
[[0, 1], [2, 3]].reduce(
  (acc, cur) => {
    return acc.concat(cur);
  },
  [1, 2],
);

/* 
Analysis:

1. The reduce() method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

2. In this code:
   - We start with the array [[0, 1], [2, 3]] (an array containing two sub-arrays)
   - The initial value for the accumulator is [1, 2]
   - For each element (which is an array itself), we concatenate it to the accumulator using concat()

3. Let's trace through the execution step by step:
   - Initial accumulator: [1, 2]
   - First iteration: 
     * acc = [1, 2]
     * cur = [0, 1]
     * acc.concat(cur) = [1, 2, 0, 1]
   - Second iteration:
     * acc = [1, 2, 0, 1]
     * cur = [2, 3]
     * acc.concat(cur) = [1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]

4. The output will be: [1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]

Note: The concat() method returns a new array and doesn't modify the original array. 
The reduce() method uses the returned value as the accumulator for the next iteration.

// To verify the output:
const result = [[0, 1], [2, 3]].reduce(
  (acc, cur) => {
    return acc.concat(cur);
  },
  [1, 2],
);

console.log("Result of the reduce operation:", result);
// This will output: [1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]
