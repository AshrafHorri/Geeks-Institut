// Exercise 3: Analyze this code

// The code to analyze:
const arrayNum = [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9];
const newArray = arrayNum.map((num, i) => {
    console.log(num, i);
    alert(num);
    return num * 2;
})

/* 
Analysis:

1. The value of 'i' in this code is the index of the current element being processed in the array.

2. In JavaScript's map function, the callback receives three arguments:
   - The current element value (here named 'num')
   - The current element index (here named 'i')
   - The array being processed (not used in this example)

3. As the map function iterates through arrayNum:
   - For the first element (1), i = 0
   - For the second element (2), i = 1
   - For the third element (4), i = 2
   - For the fourth element (5), i = 3
   - For the fifth element (8), i = 4
   - For the sixth element (9), i = 5

4. So 'i' will take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as the map function processes each element of the array.

5. The console.log(num, i) statement will print each element along with its index.
   The output would be:
   1 0
   2 1
   4 2
   5 3
   8 4
   9 5

6. The final value of newArray will be [2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 18], as each element is multiplied by 2.
